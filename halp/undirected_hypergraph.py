class UndirectedHypergraph(object):
    """
    The UndirectedHypergraph class provides an undirected hypergraph object
    and associated functions for basic properties of undirected hypergraphs.

    An undirected hypergraph contains nodes and undirected hyperedges. Each
    undirected hyperedge simply connects a set of nodes. An undirected
    hypergraph is a special case of an undirected graph, where each edge
    connects exactly 2 nodes. The set of nodes cannot be empty.

    A node is simply any hashable type. See "add_node" or "add_nodes" for
    more details.

    An undirected hyperedge is any iterable container of nodes.
    This class assigns (upon adding) and refers to each hyperedge by an
    internal ID. See "add_hyperedge" or "add_hyperedges" for more details.

    Self-loops and parallel (multi-) hyperedges are not allowed.

    :note: This class uses several data structures to store a undirected
        hypergraph. Since these structures must stay in sync (see: __init__),
        we highly recommend that only the public methods be used for accessing
        and modifying the hypergraph.

    Examples:
    Create an empty undirected hypergraph (no nodes or hyperedges).

    >>> H = UndirectedHypergraph()

    Add nodes (with or without attributes) to the hypergraph
    one at a time (see: add_node) or several at a time (see: add_nodes).

    >>> H.add_nodes(["A", "B", "C", "D"], {color: "black"})

    Add hyperedges to the hypergraph one at a time (see: add_hyperedge)
    or several at a time (see: add_hyperedges).

    >>> H.add_hyperedges(["A", "B"], ("A", "C", "D"))

    Update attributes of existing nodes and hyperedges by simulating adding the
    node or hyperedge again, with the [potentially new] attribute appended.

    >>> H.add_node("A", label="sink")
    >>> H.add_hyperedge(["A", "C", "D"], weight=5)
