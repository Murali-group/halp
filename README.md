hypergraph
==========

The style guide I think it would be best to use is pep8: http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

You can get the style checker here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8

You can get an auto formatter here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/


Testing
---------

Tests go in `tests/`.

Run tests with `python setup.py test`.

Test runner depends on
[pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html).
